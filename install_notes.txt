## Distribution
Use anaconda distribution for setting up python environments.

## Installation
Two environments are necessary (one is python2 and one is python3), 
due to a quirk in loading certain types of tif stacks in 
dual_lenslet_crop.py (which is the first stage of processing raw image data), 
for which python2 is necessary. Everything else uses python3.

> conda env create --file cosmos3requirements.yml -n cosmos3 python=3.5
> source activate cosmos3 
> python setup.py develop

(This installs and passes tests on Mac OSX 10.15.3 and Ubuntu 18.04.1)

For windows machines, use cosmos3requirement_windows.yml.
(This has been tested on ....TODO)

Then do:

> conda env create --file cosmos2requirements.yml -n cosmos2 python=2.7
> source activate cosmos2 
> python setup.py develop

(This installs on Mac OSX 10.15.3)

For linux-64, if the cosmos2requirements.yml approach does not work, you 
Should instead be able to use the spec_file:
> conda create --name cosmos2 --file cosmosdata2_spec_file.txt

(This installs on Ubuntu 18.04.1)
